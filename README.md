### Brian Alvarado / Student ID: 0004911882 
 Hello my name is Brian Alvarado. I am a online student from Tampa, FL. I started out learning C# and immediately grew a passion for coding. Moving further into my degree program I learned JavaScript, and many other languages. JavaScript quickly became my favorite. Learning a framework like React made coding much more fun for me and it's what I enjoy most.
