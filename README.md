### Brian Alvarado / Student ID: 0004911882 
 Hello my name is Brian Alvarado. I am a online student from Tampa, FL. I started out learning C# and immediately grew a passion for coding. Moving further into my degree program I learned JavaScript, and many other languages. JavaScript quickly became my favorite. Learning a framework like React made coding much more fun for me and it's what I enjoy most.

# My WordPress Portfolio 
This repo is documenting my progress for my Wordpress portfolio. During this month I will be updating and documenting my progress. 

**Week 1**: I will be doing research and making a proposal for my portfolio. A video will be submitted for Youtube show casing my portfolio progress from Wordpress. I am new to Wordpress and will be conducting some research on it as well as some ideas for my portfolio on Wordpress. 

**Week 2**: This week will require extensive research on multiple topics. With a pre-booked cuise starting Sat. Feb. 12, I plan to have all of this week completed by that date. I will spend more time when I arrive back home on the 19th of February. Google analytics is already integrated into my portfolio site and won't require much research for that aspect. I h ave listed the following research topics that will require some time to research for this week.

**Week 3**: This week is planned for watching the instructional videos and apply as much time as possible to the portfolio when I return home on the 19th. Into week 4 I should have all my projects and portfolio updated for my final video submission along with the portfolio itself. 

**Week 4**:
