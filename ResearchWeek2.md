## Search Engine Optimization: A Simple Guide to SEO Strategy
Know your audience. When developing an SEO strategy to optimize your landing page, you must understand your target audience. Knowing your target audience’s search queries can help you create quality content that answers their questions and maximizes your site's usability for their needs.
Make sure search engine crawlers can decipher your site. In order for the search engine to index your website’s pages and subpages, they must be easily accessible. Try making a sitemap—a list of links to all the important pages on your site—so the crawler can discover those pages without difficulty. If your site has non-text media like infographics, videos, and photos, text into the HTML code so the crawler knows what that media is about.
Perform keyword research. Use a keyword research tool or SEO platform to make sure you strategically use keywords with a high search volume. Keyword research should help you comprehend exactly what your audience is searching for, how they want to absorb that information, and how many people are searching for it.
Create high-quality content. Once you know what your audience is searching for, produce engrossing and informative content that answers their search queries.
Make a positive user experience. Your website should maximize your content's visibility and present it in a way that's easy to access. Increase your page speed by compressing images and upgrading to a premium web host service. Check that your content is readable and an appropriate length. Make your site mobile-friendly with a mobile-only website configuration and the elimination of pop-up windows.
Select an SEO-friendly URL and page titles. When selecting your domain name, try to incorporate a high-volume keyword in a catchy and memorable way. Get a “.com” address, as opposed to a “.net,” “.biz,” etc. When structuring and titling your subpages, select a titling system that clearly states what each page is about. For example, "samplewebsite.com/understanding_topicname" is more effective than "samplewebsite.com/page1438."
Implement technical SEO knowledge. If you have coding knowledge or can hire an SEO professional, incorporate items like meta tags and structured data markup—also called schema markup—to make it easier for crawlers to discover, organize, and present your website content. Meta tags are text snippets that describe your website's content to a search engine crawler. Meta descriptions only appear in your site's HTML source code and are not viewable on the actual page.

## How to Build a Data Analytics Portfolio
In a hands-on field like data analytics, it’s not enough to simply tell employers what you can do; they want to see proof. While your resumé summarizes your qualifications and experience, a portfolio showcases your skills in action—making it an essential tool when applying for jobs.
A portfolio website should be concise, easy to navigate, and visually appealing. There are three key areas you’ll want to include in your portfolio website, as well as an optional fourth. Let’s take a look at those now.

## How to Make a Powerful Marketing Portfolio
Marketing portfolio is a great way to highlight your best work whenever you need to show what you’ve already done as a marketer or contact potential customers.

What you’ve worked on will be organized and easily accessible. No need to create additional documents or write long emails about your previous experience.
